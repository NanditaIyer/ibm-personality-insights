# I told my therapist about you ...

This application is inspired from IBM's [Personality Insights demo](https://personality-insights-demo.ng.bluemix.net). Built entirely in React, it was a weekend excercise to not only put my React skills to test but also learn the in's and out's of [this fascinating service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/personality-insights/index.html).

## Installation

The application was bootstrapped using Facebook's create-create-app. To get started, clone this repo and run:

```
npm install
yarn start
```

You will need a companion PHP server to communicate with Watson and Twitter API. The code for the companion server is located in the php-api folder. Replace all REDACTED values with your own Watson and Twitter API keys, Access Tokens, etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
